## Student Projects

1. **Abstractive Summarisation of Long Academic Papers** by _Si Chenglei_, _Biro Daniel_

   <a href="img/proj-01.jpg"><img src="img/proj-01.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>In this project, we use two publicly available datasets to train abstractive summarisation models for long academic papers which are usually 2000 to 3000 words long. We will generate a summary of around 250 words for the papers. We also evaluate different models' performance.<br clear="both"/>

2. **CNN for Japanese Text Classification** by _Takanori Aoki_

   <a href="img/proj-02.jpg"><img src="img/proj-02.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>I developed Japanese text classifier to identify an author of a novel by using Character-Level Convoltional Neural Network (CLCNN). CLCNN realizes robust Japanese text classification. In usual way of Japanese text classification, we need to do word segmentation because there is no white space between words in Japanese language. However, CLCNN is applicable without word segmentation. In addition, CLCNN is very robust against typos and misspelling. Results of experimentation will be displayed in STePS.<br clear="both"/>

3. **Foreign Exchange Forecasting** by _Xiao Nan_, _Luo Wuqiong (Nick)_, _Yesha Simaria_, _Vikash Ranjan_

   <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>Award Winner, 2nd Prize<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>

   <a href="img/proj-03.jpg"><img src="img/proj-03.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>This project explored forecasting foreign currency exchange price using both historical price data and market news of the trading pair. We first built a market sentiment classifier to obtain daily market sentiment score from market news of the trading pair. To reduce the amount of labelled training data required, we used transfer learning technique by first training a language model using Wikipedia data, then fine-tuning the language model using market news, and finally using the language model as the basis to train the market sentiment classifier. We then combined the market sentiment score and historical price data and fed them in an end-to-end encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (RNN) to forecast foreign exchange trends.<br clear="both"/>

4. **Gaining Insight from News Articles for Stock Prediction** by _Rahul Rajesh_

   <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>Award Winner, 1st Prize<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>

   (_No poster available, sorry!_) Stock market prediction has been an active area of research for a long time. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that stock market prices are largely driven by new information and follow a random walk pattern.  In this study, we test a hypothesis based on the premise of behavioral economics, that the emotions and moods of individuals affect their decision making process, thus, leading to a direct correlation between "public sentiment" and "market sentiment". We specially look to see if there is any correlation between what people post on twitter and the movement of prices in the stock market. Based off recent happenings in the news, this study is focused on Tesla.<br clear="both"/>

5. **MC NLP Rap Lyrics Generator** by _Zhou Yizhuo_

   <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>Award Winner, 3rd Prize<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i>

   <a href="img/proj-05.png"><img src="img/proj-05.s.png" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a> Natural language generation is an NLP task which has drawn attention widely in recent years. Besides commercial NLG technology such as chatbot, generating literary works is another interesting application. Some work has been done on writing Shakespeare's poem and generating paragraph with Harry Potter's style. As a rap lover, I believe that generating rap lyrics is much more realistic since some rap lyrics written by human are not meaningful. In this project, I start from training a character-level language model using LSTM based on Eminem's songs' lyrics dataset which contains around 50000 lines of lyrics. Then I will explore word-level model to examine the new generator's performance. The ultimate goal of this project is generating several lines of rap lyrics which might be identified as human's works by testers.<br clear="both"/>

6. **Open Source Software Vulnerability Identification With Machine Learning** by _Chen Yang_

   (_No poster available, sorry!_) There are different data sources we can identify vulnerabilities for open source software. One is the text information from Github issue, Bugzilla , Jira tickets, emails, another is the commit patch. We use traditional machine learning algorithms to identify vulnerability from above source already. Deep learning is used to to identify commits message in this project to compare the result with traditional algorithms. It shows deep learning can get better result even with less features.<br clear="both"/>

7. **Reading Comprehension with Lecture Notes** by _Nguyen Van Hoang_, _Lee Pei Xuan_, _Kevin Leonardo_, _Calvin Tantio_, _Luong Quoc Trung_, _Tan Joon Kai Daniel_

   <a href="img/proj-07.jpg"><img src="img/proj-07.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>This project explores the application of open-domain Question Answering (QA) in learning materials with a contribution of a lecture note dataset, called LNQA, annotated with question-answer pairs. Our approach is to improve the overall pipeline of lecture note reading comprehension involving context retrieving (finding the relevant slides) and text reading (identifying the correct information). Experiments show that initializing our text reader model with a pre-trained version on SQuAD significantly improve its performance on much limited lecture note dataset, comparing with both training from scratch and inferring from the pre-trained model. Narrowing down the search space by specifying departments of questions also helps improve document retriever results, thus we examine state-of-the-art sentence classifiers in predicting departments of questions.<br clear="both"/>

8. **Beyond Affine Neurons** by _Mirco Milletari_, _Mohit Rajpal_

   <a href="img/proj-08.jpg"><img src="img/proj-08.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have emerged as one of the most successful framework for time series prediction and natural language processing. However, the fundamental building block of RNNs, the perceptron [1], has remained largely unchanged since its inception: a nonlinearity applied to an affine function. An affine function cannot easily capture the complex behavior of functions of degree 2 and higher. The sum of products signal propagation for the hidden state and current input incorrectly assumes that these two variables are independent and uncoupled. RNNs are increasingly forced to use very large number of neurons in complex architectures to achieve good results. In this project, inspired by Ref. [2], we propose to add simple and efficient degree 2 behavior to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) neuron cells to improve the expressive power of each individual neuron. We analyze the benefits of our approach with respect to common language prediction tasks. The clear advantage of our approach is fewer neurons and therefore reduced computational complexity and cost.

9. **CNN-RNN for Image Annotation with Label Correlations** by _Xiao Junbin_, _Hu Zikun_, _Lim Joo Gek_, _Tan Kay Pong_

   <a href="img/proj-09.jpg"><img src="img/proj-09.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great success in image recognition where one image belongs to only one category (label), whereas in multi-label prediction, their performances are suboptimal mainly for their neglection of the label correlations. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are superior in capturing label relationships, such as label dependency and semantic redundancy. Hence, in this project we implement a CNN-RNN framework for multi-label image annotation by exploiting CNN’s capability for image-to-label recognition and RNN’s complement in label-to-label inference. We experiment on the popular benchmark IAPRTC12 to show that CNN-RNN can help improve the performance on the CNN baseline.<br clear="both"/>

1. **Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions** by _Nguyen Ngoc Tram Anh_, _Louis Tran_, _Jet New_, _Leong Kwok Hing_, _Tran Minh Hoang_

   <a href="img/proj-10.jpg"><img src="img/proj-10.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a> _no abstract submitted_.  Original Author: Danqi Chen, Adam Fisch, Jason Weston and Antoine Bordes.<br clear="both"/>

1. **Source Code Comment Generation** by _Praveen Sanap_

   <a href="img/proj-11.jpg"><img src="img/proj-11.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>The number of high quality, well documented, open sources projects has only increased.  I propose that, with the advances in NLP, a deep learning model can learn to make comments for a source code from such data.<br clear="both"/>

1. **Axiomatic attribution for neural translation** by _Ang Ming Liang_, _Ang Chew Hoe_

   <a href="img/proj-12.jpg"><img src="img/proj-12.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>The recent success of Neural Machine Translators (NMT), have shown the power of using neural approaches to the problem of machine translation.  Nonetheless, one of the biggest problems if NMT and deep learning models in general is their lack of interpretability.  In light of this, this projects aims to "unbox" the black box of widely use NMT models using the axiomatic attribution framework proposed by M Sundarajan et al 2017.

1. **Legal Text Classifier with Universal Language Model Fine-tuning** by _Lim How Khang_

   <a href="img/proj-13.jpg"><img src="img/proj-13.s.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;padding:5px" width="150" /></a>Recent work has shown that pre-training a neural language model on large public text datasets improves the accuracy of a neural text classifier while requiring fewer labelled training samples.  We use the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning method introduced by Howard and Ruder (2018)* to train a legal text classifier to perform 19-way legal topic classification on a dataset of 3,588 legal judgments issued by the Singapore Court of Appeal and High Court.
